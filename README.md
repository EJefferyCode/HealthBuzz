# HealthBuzz

<h1>This project is a bootstrap based interactive page</h1>

This is a mock site called HealthBuzz.com 

It includes the following: 

<ul>
<li>Search box underneath the footer of the page. Ths input/box spans the width of the entire page, and runs smoothly during break points</li>
<li>Bootstrap Glyphicons, and Bootstrap-social.css social media icons that can be linked</li>
<li>A carousel that contains featured articles/stories</li>
<li>A horizontal space labeled "possible ad space" for, of course, possible horizontal ad placement</li>
<li>Log In and Sign up forms that contain Vanilla JS validation for the amount of chars as well as password confirmation</li>
<li>Sticky menu</li>
</ul>
